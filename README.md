## Informations

Our project aims to create an application for the generation of video-fun flora


The source code is in the `src/` directory, the source code for the tests is in the `test/` directory

The overview.html file as well as the `src/**/package-info.java` files are used when generating the javadoc

To compile the source files in the `bin/directory`, run the command: `ant compile`

To compile then run the program, run the command: `ant run`

To generate a jar archive in the `build/directory`, run the command: `ant packaging`

To generate the javadoc in the `doc/` folder, run the command: `ant javadoc`
Then open the index.html or overview-summary.html file in a browser.

To perform the tests, run the command: `ant tests`
A result.txt file will be generated displaying the results as well as a copy of the standard output.

All files are in the archive, so compilation and execution do not require internet connection
